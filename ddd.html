<h1>Documentation page of Han Wang's map</h1><p>My design process:</p><p>I start from drawing the streets since it is the first step and the easiest one. I have a roughly clear plan about my visualizations. I should basically divide my page into two parts and the left part goes with my map and the right part goes with my charts and diagrams and everything.</p><p> I considered about the diagram which can be controled to show the deaths on the map for a really long time. I tried several ways of representing it and finally I decided to represent that in such way: you click on a bar then the deaths of that day would appear on map as small red dots since red represents death. </p><p>Rationale of your design choices: </p><p>I had a hard time choosing colors represent ages and genders since there should be so many different colors and these colors should match my map backgroud as well as suitable for people who is vision disabled in some aspect. I downloaded color oracle and checked it with my thought for many times and then the final color I represent is good and will not cause any visual problem to certain people.</p>
